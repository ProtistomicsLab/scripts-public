## **Currently in the repository:**

* **[branchlen.py](https://github.com/ProtistomicsLab/scripts-public/blob/main/branchlen.py)** (by Kacper Maciszewski - for extracting branch length data from Newick trees)

Usage: ```python branchlen.py input_newick.tre```

* **[kocur.py](https://github.com/ProtistomicsLab/scripts-public/blob/main/kocur.py)** (by Monika Wiśniewska - for finding monophyletic clades of given taxa in phylogenetic trees)

Usage: ```python kocur.py input.tre```

For those curious about the name - it is related to the phrase "drevny kocur" (with various spelling variants, all roughly translating to "tree cat"), which is supposed to mean "squirrel" in Czech language according to Poles, or in Slovak language according to Czechs. The phrase does not actually exist in any of those languages (the word for "squirrel" is "wiewiórka" in Polish, "veverka" in Czech, and "veverica" in Slovak), but it is just one of many linguistic jokes, prompted by the Slavic people considering their neighbors' languages to sound funny.
